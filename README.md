# **about me :^)**
Hi! My name's opan! A musician based in Indonesia.  

Every art/audio related stuff you'll see in the mod is stuff I made myself, like the custom music, Joker art, etc.  
I kind of used the process of creating this mod as another creative outlet, and also use it to sort of dip my feet into the coding world.  

If you're interested in my music, come visit my [YouTube Channel!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-G7Ncai-sKSiAPYRF7jnaA)  
or maybe even my [Spotify!](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Fza8B3hrUPECAdbYHQD5a?si=NE9LmaVLQ1iVHyleo2PhDA)  

# **about the mod**
From the start, I only wanted to tweak some Jokers in vanilla Balatro, and kind of play around with them. Make them OP, change their functions, etc.  
Then I begin to find out how to make my own Jokers, and it all went downhill from there.  

As stated before, this mod currently has:
- 60 new Jokers
- 1 "new" Tarot Card
- 1 new Spectral Card
- 1 new Tag

# **INSTALLATION**
- Make sure you're downloading from the Releases tab and DO NOT download from the green [ <> Code ] button
- After download is complete, open the .zip file
- Drag and drop the "OpandorasBox" folder into your Mods folder
- If everything is done correctly, it should look like Mods > OpandorasBox > (the mod's files)

### [NeatoJokers](https://github.com/neatoqueen/NeatoJokers) by [Neato](https://github.com/neatoqueen), [Larswijn](https://github.com/larswijn), and [Lia_Fr0st](https://github.com/liafr0st)  
I LOVE THIS MOD!!! Neato did so well for the art on the cards, and they look so sick and fits Balatro so well.  
And the coding for it too, they're so... clean? I don't know how to explain it.  
I've adapted how they just call multiple files inside the folders of the mod, with just one really short block of code.  
And also the description related stuff as well.  
Larswijn and Lia_Fr0st did such a good job on the programming part of the mod.  

This is imo THE best mod to use as a foundation on how to create vanilla-friendly Jokers, or just how to start modding in general.  
GET IT!!! GET IT NOW!!!!!!  

### [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) by [SleepyG11](https://github.com/SleepyG11)  
Useful & great mod to have in general. I've used their system to do set keybinds to button (with permission) for the next/previous music track.  
I wouldn't understand how to make the "button" in UIButton functional in the first place if it wasn't for this.  

### [Card Sleeves](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves) by [Larswijn](https://github.com/larswijn)  
Just a sick mod to have in general. Get it. Now.  

### [Paperback](https://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback)  
Such a cool mod, combined with crazy good looking art for the cards. GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!   

### [Balatro Colour Selector](https://github.com/EmperorGesar/Balatro-Colour-Selector) by [EmperorGesar](https://github.com/EmperorGesar)  
Mod might be outdated, but I did use this mod for reference on how to change the background colors of the main menu.  

## Always up for discussion and change, if any of these are too overpowered.
