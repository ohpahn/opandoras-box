# **Opandora's Box - A Balatro Mod**
**56** new ***Jokers***, **1** new ***Tarot Card***, **1** new ***Spectral Card***, **1** new ***Tag***.
# **HOW TO INSTALL**
- Open Balatro's game directory, where the Balatro.exe resides in
- Make a backup of Balatro.exe (a must if you want to go back to vanilla)
- Open Balatro.exe using 7zip
- Open the "Opandora's Box" folder in the ZIP/RAR file
- Move all of the contents inside the "Opandora's Box" folder into Balatro.exe's archive, overwriting every files in it.

# **THE MOD**
Let me start this off by saying that I am in no way close to being a coder, I just see patterns that are already inside card.lua and try to make new Jokers based on that.

So if you encounter any bugs, PLEASE tell me and if possible, help me out if you understand coding, cause this is a WHOLE new territory for me.

Anyways, the mod's name is kind of supposed to be pronounced like "Oh-pun-dora's box" cause my name's in it, but say it however you want!

Originally, this mod was going to be just a rebalance of the Jokers already in-game.
Then I found out how to make my own Jokers, and it all went downhill from there.

The goal for this mod is to make new and vanilla friendly-ish Jokers, goes for the art as well, as I've (mostly) stuck with Balatro's original color palette
and try to replicate the art style too so it doesn't look out of place (though some of them do imo).
And some Jokers have their own SFX!
And I also added a version, in which it has custom soundtracks I made myself!

The reason I didn't create this mod under Steamodded is because;
- I wasn't thinking about the possibility of making my own jokers at first.
- It'll be much easier for me to play this mod on my phone.
- my brain too dumb dumb and scared to start converting it to work with Steamodded.

Also, sorry if there's any mispelling or like, weird forming of words/grammar on the Joker descriptions, I'm Indonesian and English isn't my first language.

### OPTIONS

# CURRENT BUGS
- **xChips**: Sound works, but the little blue pop-up particle below the card shows as orange/yellow for some reason, even though I've changed it to G.C.BLUE, tried G.C.CHIPS or G.C.XCHIPS and it still doesn't work.
- **Pendulum**: If it shows as Xchips, and you exit the game then join back, it will show as - Xmult, but will still play as Xchips.
- **Disciple**: The custom Xchips SFX doesn't scale up with this Joker, even though it does with Pendulum.
- **Balanzone**: Semi-works, if you have 2 Jokers under "context.after". (let's say you have 2 Jimbos) and 1 Balanzone, instead of the total being +16 Mult, it'll give a total of +12 Mult.

## If somebody can help me figure these bugs out that'll be great!
DM me on Discord (@ohpahn) if you can help and because I don't know how to use github at ***ALL***

(except for marking out words like ***this*** cause ***this*** looks ***cool*** as ***hell***

## Always up for discussion and change, if any of these are too overpowered.
